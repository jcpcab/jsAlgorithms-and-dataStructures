//BIG O NOTATIONS : A way to formalize fuzzy counting /  Allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow



//      •It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
//      •Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
//      •When your code slows down or crashes,identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
//       •Less important:it comes up in interviews!
